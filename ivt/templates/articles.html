        Most people effortlessly recognize those digits as 504192. That ease is deceptive. In each hemisphere of our
        brain, humans have a primary visual cortex, also known as V1, containing 140 million neurons, with tens of
        billions of connections between them. And yet human vision involves not just V1, but an entire series of visual
        cortices - V2, V3, V4, and V5 - doing progressively more complex image processing. We carry in our heads a
        supercomputer, tuned by evolution over hundreds of millions of years, and superbly adapted to understand the
        visual world. Recognizing handwritten digits isn't easy. Rather, we humans are stupendously, astoundingly good
        at making sense of what our eyes show
